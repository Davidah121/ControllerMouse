# ControllerMouse

<h1>Premise</h1>
<p>This project was a very simple project that allows you to control the mouse with any xinput controller.</p>
<p>This program uses both the xinput and windows api to read input and move the mouse.</p>
<p>You can move the cursor with the left analog stick, press A to perform a left click, press B to perform a right click.</p>
