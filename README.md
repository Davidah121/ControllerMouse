# ControllerMouse

<h1>Premise</h1>
<p>This project was a very simple project that allows you to control the mouse with any xinput controller.</p>
<p>This program uses both the xinput and windows api to read input and move the mouse.</p>
<p>Controls</p>
<ul>
  <li>The left analog stick moves the mouse cursor.</li>
  <li>The right analog stick behaves as the mouse scroll wheel.</li>
  <li>The A button is the left mouse button</li>
  <li>The B button is the right mouse button</li>
  <li>The X button is the middle mouse button</li>
</ul>

<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>This project was mostly just to use the XInput api in a interactable example.</p>
